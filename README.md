## 📊 Key Features

- Filters games based on:
  - CPU generation or model
  - GPU model
  - RAM (in GB)
  - Storage space
- Recommends best-suited games
- Visualizes hardware requirements across game genres

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Dataset is loaded and cleaned.
2. User's PC specs are input manually (for now).
3. Games with system requirements lower than or equal to user specs are selected.
4. Top recommendations are displayed.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Create a web-based app using Streamlit
- Let users input specs through a form
- Add genre filters (RPG, FPS, Strategy, etc.)
- Compare game performance ratings by user reviews
